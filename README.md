# Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)

The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) Open Project is an 
[OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) fostering an open cybersecurity 
ecosystem, where products from all vendors and software publishers can freely exchange 
information, insights, analytics, and orchestrated response, via commonly developed code 
and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies, data standards, and procedures.

For more information on the OCA, see the project's website at https://opencybersecurityalliance.org. 

General questions about OASIS Open Projects may be directed to OASIS staff at [op-admin@lists.oasis-open-projects.org](mailto:op-admin@lists.oasis-open-projects.org).
