## Date: 5 September 2025

**Present:** Duncan Sparrell (SFractal), Claudia Rauch (OASIS), Vasileios Mavroeidis (CYENTIFC), Vaughan Shanks (Cydarm), Kelly Cullinane (OASIS)

## Summary

The meeting began with a discussion about quorum requirements and the future of OCA, where the group explored options for the organization's sustainability despite lack of sufficient participation and sponsorship. The board discussed the potential closure of OCA and its projects, with concerns raised about the organization's viability and the need to find new board chairs. The group agreed to give current and potential sponsors an opportunity to step up as chairs before considering the closure of the organization, while also discussing the possibility of transferring OCA's work to other organizations if needed.

## Notes

* **Welcome and Quorum**  
  * The meeting began with a discussion about quorum requirements, where it was confirmed that four PGB members are needed for voting. With three active PGB members present, quorum was not reached.  
* **Project Dissolution Options Discussion**  
  * The group discussed the potential dissolution of an open project, with Kelly and Claudia clarifying that the discussion was initiated by Jason to explore options due to the expected loss of sponsors. They emphasized that no immediate vote is required to explore these options, and the process for dissolution is still in the early stages. The conversation focused on understanding the available options and the process involved in making a final decision.  
* **OCA's Sustainability and Membership Challenges**	  
  * Duncan noted that while there are active projects, current sponsors will not be members by year-end. Vaughan, as co-chair and CEO of Cydarm Technologies, expressed that continued sponsorship without other members would not be justified, and his company would not renew its membership. Vaughan shared a previously proposed business plan to revitalize OCA but noted lack of interest from others.   
* **OCA Viability and Sponsorship Challenges**	  
  * The group discussed the viability of the OCA organization and its impact on ongoing projects. Vaughan emphasized the need to find a transition plan that would allow communities to continue their work even if the OCA is no longer viable. Vasileios agreed and mentioned that his company will likely not renew their membership due. Claudia provided an update on the current sponsors, noting that several companies, including Vaughan's and Duncan's, are not renewing their memberships. The remaining sponsors are potentially Prophecy, Sekoia, and TNO.  
* **Seeking New PGB Chairs**  
  * The group discussed the need to find a new PGB chair. Vaughan suggested notifying current sponsors about the opportunity to step up as chairs, while Duncan recommended reaching out to the broader community of 100+ participants. The group agreed to give potential sponsors a chance to step forward before considering closing the organization, though they acknowledged this outcome was likely.  
* **Community Sustainability and Leadership Challenges**  
  * The group discussed archiving projects and the challenges of maintaining community involvement without sufficient PGB sponsorship. Duncan clarified that while there is a strong community, the issue lies in leadership, management, and financial support. Kelly and Claudia agreed to send emails regarding project transitions.   
* **PGB Closure Plan Discussion**  
  * Vaughan proposed a three-step plan: notify current members about stepping up as chair, reach out to the broader community for sponsorship, and, if neither occurs, put out a conditional resolution to close the PGB. Duncan suggested doing all three steps simultaneously to expedite the process. Kelly and Claudia offered to help draft the resolution language. The group agreed to give a month for responses before proceeding with the closure vote.

## Next steps

* Claudia and Kelly: Send emails to remaining sponsors asking if they want to nominate a chair for the OCA board.  
* Claudia and Kelly: Notify the broader OCA community about the potential closure and opportunity to become sponsors.
