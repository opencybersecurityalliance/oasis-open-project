# Open Cybersecurity Alliance Community Governance -- DRAFT

## 1\. Purpose

The Open Cybersecurity Alliance Community (hereafter, the OCA Community) exists to preserve and advance the mission, brand, and collaborative value of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance following the sunset of the OASIS Open Project model. The OCA Community provides a lightweight, sustainable framework for community-led collaboration, interoperability demonstrations, and innovation aligned with OASIS cybersecurity standards.

This document defines the governance, operating principles, and lifecycle expectations for efforts operating under the OCA Community name.

## 2\. Scope and Positioning

The OCA Community operates as an OASIS-governed community brand or member initiative, not as a sponsored Open Project. It is intended to:

* Serve as a neutral collaboration space for demonstrating interoperability across OASIS cybersecurity standards.  
* Support community-driven tools, reference implementations, and demonstrations.  
* Provide visibility and continuity for existing OCA efforts while reducing administrative overhead.  
* Enable mature or active efforts to transition into appropriate OASIS Technical Committees when alignment exists.

The OCA Community does not provide guaranteed staff technical support, funding, or formal project management. All efforts are expected to be substantially self-managed.

## 3\. Governance Authority

Overall authority for the OCA Community rests with the OASIS Board of Directors. OASIS retains ownership of the OCA name and brand and exercises oversight to ensure that activities conducted under the OCA Community remain aligned with OASIS policies and strategic objectives.

OASIS staff, in coordination with designated OCA community leadership, administers the governance processes described in this document.

## 4\. Community Leadership and Roles

### 4.1 Community Leadership

OASIS may designate one or more community leads or points of contact to:

* Coordinate with OASIS staff on governance matters.  
* Facilitate communication across OCA Community projects.  
* Support onboarding and offboarding of initiatives.

Community leadership roles are facilitative rather than directive; individual projects remain self-managed.

### 4.2 Project Maintainers

Each approved OCA Community project must identify at least two maintainers who:

* Serve as the primary points of contact for the project.  
* Ensure continuity of engagement and responsiveness.  
* Are responsible for compliance with this governance document.

Maintainers are responsible for technical direction, community engagement, and day-to-day project operations.

## 5\. Establishment of Community Projects

### 5.1 Proposal Requirements

Any new effort seeking to operate under the OCA Community must submit a short written proposal (approximately one page) that includes:

* Purpose and scope of the effort.  
* Relevance to one or more OASIS standards or Technical Committees.  
* Expected deliverables and outcomes.  
* Identification of at least two maintainers.

### 5.2 Review and Approval

Proposals are jointly reviewed by OASIS staff and OCA community leadership to assess alignment, feasibility, and compliance with OASIS policies.

Final approval to operate under the OCA Community name requires authorization by the OASIS Board of Directors.

No project may represent itself as part of the OCA Community prior to Board approval.

## 6\. Licensing and Participation Requirements

All OCA Community projects must:

* Require contributors to sign the OASIS Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  
* Use an OASIS-approved open source license (see [here](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#repository-specification-licenses-licenseList)), with Apache License 2.0 as the default unless otherwise approved.  
* Conduct work in a transparent and publicly accessible manner.

## 7\. Project Operations

Projects under the OCA Community are self-managed. There is no expectation of:

* Dedicated OASIS technical staff support.  
* Guaranteed infrastructure beyond community-approved repositories and communication channels.  
* Financial sponsorship or reimbursement.  
* Projects are expected to:  
  * Welcome and onboard new participants  
  * Share information regarding CLA requirements and ensure signatures  
  * Maintain accurate documentation.  
  * Communicate periodically with the broader community.  
  * Respond to OASIS inquiries related to governance or compliance.

## 8\. Activity Review and Archival Policy

To maintain an active and credible community, OASIS conducts reviews of OCA Community projects twice annually, typically in March and September.

### 8.1 Inactivity Criteria

A project may be considered inactive if, for a continuous period of six months, it demonstrates:

* No substantive commits or updates to associated repositories.  
* No engagement on designated communication channels.  
* No communication with OASIS staff or community leadership.

### 8.2 Archival Process

When a project is identified as an archival candidate:

* OASIS will notify the listed maintainers and provide a minimum of two weeks to respond.  
* Maintainers may object or provide evidence of renewed activity.  
* Absent a response or reasonable objection, the project may be archived.

Archived projects remain publicly accessible for reference under their existing licenses but are no longer considered active OCA Community efforts.

## 9\. Relationship to OASIS Technical Committees

OCA Community projects that align with the charter and scope of an existing OASIS Technical Committee may request adoption by that TC.

Adoption requires mutual agreement between the project maintainers and the Technical Committee and must comply with applicable TC governance rules. Adoption is optional and not required for continued operation within the OCA Community e.

## 10\. Brand, Marketing, and Events

OASIS retains primary authority over the use of the OCA name and branding.

Community activities may include:

* Interoperability demonstrations and plugfests (e.g., CASP Plugfest).  
* Joint marketing or outreach activities approved by OASIS.  
* Public events emphasizing multi-standard interoperability.

All external representations must accurately reflect the project’s status as an OASIS-governed community. 

## 11\. Infrastructure and Communication Channels

OASIS determines which shared infrastructure remains available to the OCA Community, including:

* GitHub organization and repositories.  
* Mailing lists and communication platforms.  
* Limited administrative access for designated project leads.

Inactive infrastructure may be retired at OASIS discretion following community notice.

## 12\. Amendments

This governance document may be updated by OASIS to reflect evolving needs, provided that reasonable notice is given to the community. Continued participation constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

##  13\. Effective Date - TBC

This Governance Document becomes effective upon approval by the OASIS Board of Directors and supersedes references to the former OASIS Open Project charter for activities conducted under the Open Cybersecurity Alliance Community.
