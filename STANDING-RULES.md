We adopt the following standing rules, as allowed under Oasis Open Project Rule 5.7.

## Standing Rule 2024-01

Resolved: The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) Project Governing Board adopts [Open Project Rule 5.7(a)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#project-governing-board-adjust-voting-rights) as follows:
Voting Members of the PGB who are absent from three consecutive meetings of the PGB (as recorded in the minutes) lose their voting rights, whether for e-ballot or in a PGB meeting, at the end of the third meeting missed and will not be counted towards quorum in a PGB meeting. However, they shall retain all other rights, privileges, and obligations afforded to PGB members.

A Persistent Non-Voting Member retains participation rights and obligations but is not eligible to vote and does not count towards quorum.
A Persistent Non-Voting Member may regain voting rights by (a) declaring to the Chair their desire to regain voting rights and then (b) attending two consecutive meetings of the PGB. The Member shall also then count towards quorum of PGB meetings.
